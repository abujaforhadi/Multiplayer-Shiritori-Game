# Multiplayer Shiritori Game

A simple two-player Shiritori game built using the MERN stack. Players take turns entering words, where each new word must begin with the last letter of the previous word. Words must be valid English words and cannot be repeated.

## Features
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players take turns automatically.
- **Word Validation**: Words are checked using [DictionaryAPI](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
- **Word Structure Validation**: Ensures words start with the last letter of the previous word, have at least 4 letters, and are not repeated.
- **Countdown Timer**: Each player has a limited time to submit a word.
- **Score Tracking**: Players earn or lose points based on word validity and timeouts.
- **Word History Display**: Previously used words are shown to avoid repetition.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on Vercel.
